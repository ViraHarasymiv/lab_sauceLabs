# Lab 1: Page Object Model & TestNG
The project is made by using Page Object Model and TestNG framework. Log4j is used for logging events. All logs are saved in the directory named logs (target/logs/appTest.log).

Selenium's source code is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.

The target website is [BPB PUBLICATIONS](http://practice.bpbonline.com/index.php).

- The "DataProvider" annotation is used in order to pass multiple parameters to the Creating New Account test with invalid data. Using DataProviders, we can easily pass multiple values to a test in just one execution cycle.
- The "Parameter" annotation is used in order to pass multiple parameters to the Creating New Account test with valid data

Automated tests (for chrome and opera browsers):
